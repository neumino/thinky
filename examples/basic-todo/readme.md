# Todo example with Thinky and ExpressJS

This was originally an example to illustrate AngularJS. It was slightly modified to support a real server that would save the todos.  
The code using thinky is in the file `app.js`.

### Run ###

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

Update `config.js` if you are not using RethinkDB default parameters.

Start the server with
```
node app.js
```
